### Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Truemarkets is a news and information source on the frontier of alternative media.

At its core, it is a decentralized prediction market that enables users to forecast outcomes of real world events.&#x20;

It breaks down information asymmetries pertaining to global headlines by allowing people with skin in the game to express real-time sentiment around events or news.

While traditional news sources propagate the opinions of key leaders, Truemarkets propagates news through the power of open markets.

The subjective sentiment expressed through markets may not bear truth itself, but it does represent a real-time data point that increases in accuracy as more people scrutinize these markets.

Truemarkets exposes the real-time sentiment behind news and fosters the search for answers by resolving prediction markets related to the underlying events.

If a prediction market is a truth machine, then its “truth” is only as good as its source (oracle).&#x20;

Asking a question is easy, but finding the answer is costly.&#x20;

Truemarkets places bounties on truth.

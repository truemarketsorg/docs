# Governance

In the early stages of the project, Truemarkets governance will be partially managed on snapshot, partially delegated to the Oracle Council, and partially determined through novel futarchy experiments.

Due to constantly evolving standards, it is important for the protocol to remain flexible with regards to governance and be ready to adopt modern frameworks as they emerge.

All protocol configs are controlled by governance (and TRUE holders by extension), with the goal of eventually putting as many modules onchain as possible.

## Onchain Domain

To go a step further, in a commitment to decentralization, Truemarkets will be adopting a novel onchain tokenized domain solution powered by [3DNS](https://x.com/3dns_inc). This novel approach to domain ownership means that the domain is controlled entirely through code.

The Truemarkets.org domain is a tokenized onchain NFT that can be controlled by traditional multi-sigs and even complex smart contracts.&#x20;

3DNS is an ICANN registered domain solution that comes with fall back procedures which protect tokenized domain holders in case 3DNS decides to discontinues their service.

In the worst case, the project's tokenized domain reverts to a web2 system, and in the best case, the community retains long term control over a key component of the application - the domain.

# True Yield Dollar - TYD

TYD is a yield-bearing stablecoin fully backed by USDC. It is an ERC-4626 standard vault token deployed in collaboration with, and powered by Yearn Finance.

The yield comes from a Yearn vault exclusive to Truemarkets users. This vault is designed to earn returns through low-risk strategies, aiming to outperform or match the Aave USDC lending rate on Base.

The integration of a yield-bearing stablecoin into the protocol is key to enhancing the viability of long-term markets and improving the overall economics of our prediction markets.

# Tokenomics

TRUE is the protocol token for Truemarkets.

## Token functions:

* controls protocol fees

* source of economic subjectivity in dispute resolution

This multi-utility approach ensures that the security of the oracle scales with the success of the application, and that the economics of the app are in harmony with that of the oracle.

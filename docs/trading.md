# Trading

Truemarkets is a binary prediction market, meaning each market resolves to a single, clearly defined yes-or-no question.

Market outcomes are priced in real time based on free-market perceived probabilities. Pricing is determined by traders and market makers who supply liquidity for YES and NO outcome tokens, enabling continuous price discovery.

Upon market resolution, the token corresponding to the correct outcome becomes redeemable, while the opposing token expires worthless. For example, if a market resolves to YES, each YES token is redeemable for 1 $TYD, and each NO token expires worthless—and vice versa.

Trading of YES and NO tokens on Truemarkets is fully non-custodial. All trades execute directly onchain via a custom-built Uniswap v4 hook. At no point do Truemarkets contracts take custody of, or exercise control over, users’ YES or NO tokens.

To express a view on a market, users simply purchase the token corresponding to their preferred outcome. 

For instance, if a user buys YES tokens at 0.50 TYD and the market resolves to YES, those tokens can be redeemed for 1 $TYD each—representing a 100% return on the position, net of fees.

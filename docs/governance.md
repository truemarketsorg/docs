# Governance

Truemarkets governance will be partially managed on snapshot, partially delegated to the Oracle Council, and partially determined through novel futarchy experiments.

Due to constantly evolving standards, it is important for the protocol to remain flexible with regards to governance and be ready to adopt modern frameworks as they emerge.

All protocol configs are controlled by governance (and TRUE holders by extension), with the goal of eventually putting as many modules onchain as possible.

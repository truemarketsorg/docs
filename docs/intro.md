# Introduction

Truemarkets is a fully onchain, yield-bearing prediction market protocol designed for trust-minimized trading and resolution. 

Every market’s title, resolution criteria, and approved data sources are immutably committed onchain at launch, eliminating ambiguity and ex-post manipulation.

All liquidity provisioning and order matching occur directly onchain, ensuring transparent price discovery and verifiable execution without reliance on centralized intermediaries.

This architecture is paired with a comprehensive Optimistic Oracle framework for market resolution, enabling scalable, incentive-aligned outcomes while preserving permissionless dispute resolution.

Together, these design choices give Truemarkets industry-leading decentralization and censorship-resistance, making it a robust foundation for open, global prediction markets.

# Disputing outcomes

In Truemarkets, disputers are drawn from the same permissionless participant set as resolvers. Anyone who disagrees with a proposed market resolution may dispute it during the challenge window following the proposal.

Disputers play a critical role in the protocol as stewards of truth. They serve as the first line of defense against manipulation, ensuring that the oracle system operates in an orderly and credible manner.

To dispute a pending resolution, a participant posts a bond equal to the resolver's bond and calls the `openDispute` function on the unresolved market. The disputer must also submit a `_disputeString` describing the basis for the dispute.

If the dispute is upheld, the disputer's bond is returned and a reward is paid for the successful challenge.

Truemarkets supports a three-stage arbitration process, with each escalation triggered by an unresolved or contested dispute:

1. **Initial Challenge** — A resolution proposal may be challenged by posting a relatively small bond.
2. **Oracle Council Appeal** — Disputing an Oracle Council decision requires a larger bond.
3. **Token Holder Vote** — To dispute the outcome of a token holder vote, the disputing wallet must hold at least 250,000 TRUE tokens (or equivalent voting power).

This tiered arbitration structure balances accessibility with escalating economic guarantees, ensuring that only strongly justified disputes advance to higher-resolution layers.

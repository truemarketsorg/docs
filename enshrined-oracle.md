# Enshrined Oracle

## Dispute resolution <a href="#dispute-resolution" id="dispute-resolution"></a>

Truemarkets uses a dispute resolution implementation which follows the [Truth Oracle](https://truth-oracle.gitbook.io/truth-oracle) framework.

Like most optimistic oracles, proposed resolutions are "optimistically" considered valid unless disputed.

If a proposed resolution is disputed, the protocolâ€™s oracle system kicks in. The enshrined oracle has three stages of escalation with intersubjective perspectives applied through the progression.

An initial dispute can be filed permissionlessly during the challenge window, by anyone who pledges a bond equal to that of the resolver. Upon dispute, the Oracle Council will resolve the matter by setting a result for the market as well as the slashing conditions for the two bonds.

After an Oracle Council resolution, another challenge window is triggered during which a dispute can be filed again. Doing so requires pledging a bond of $5000.

This escalation is arbitrated by TRUE holders who cast votes for the correct result and corresponding slashing conditions.

If the community is further dissatisfied by a TRUE holder decision, they can once again dispute that outcome and escalate the matter to the highest arbiters in the protocol: Attesters.

Attesters submit the final verdict for disputed markets. An attester pool is currently comprised of provably reputable individuals. When a dispute is escalated to attesters, 11 of them are randomly selected to vote on what they believe to be the market's "true" outcome (pun intended).

## Oracle progression

Stage 0)

Resolution is proposed:

* Resolver puts up a $750 bond and proposes resolution

Stage 1)

Resolution is disputed during the \[12 hour] challenge window:

* Someone disagrees and disputes the result by putting up an equal bond

Stage 2)

Oracle Council resolves dispute:

* Oracle Council votes on resolution
* Oracle Council decides slashing conditions for the resolver
* Oracle Council decides slashing conditions for the disputer

Stage 3)

Escalation occurs during the \[12 hour] challenge window:

* Disputer puts up a $7500 bond to escalate the matter to token holders for voting

Stage 4)

TRUE holders propose a resolution:

* Vote on outcome of the market
* Vote on slashing conditions

Stage 5)

Escalation occurs during the \[12 hour] challenge window:

* Disputer holding 250,000 TRUE tokens disputes the previous vote

Stage 6)

A random selection of Attesters from the jury pool submit a final verdict:

* 11 Attesters are randomly selected to resolve dispute
* If an Attester is non-responsive, another is selected from the Attester Pool
* Attesters vote on outcome of the market
* Attesters vote on slashing conditions of resolver
* Attesters vote on slashing conditions of 1st disputer
* Attesters vote on slashing conditions of 2nd disputer

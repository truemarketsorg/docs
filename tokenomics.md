# Tokenomics

TRUE is a multi-function utility token in Truemarkets as well as its enshrined oracle.

## Token functions: <a href="#token-functions" id="token-functions"></a>

* controls protocol fees
* governs Truemarkets, its branding and domain
* source of economic subjectivity in dispute resolution
* governs oracle configurations

This multi-utility approach ensures that the security of the oracle scales with the success of the application and that the economics of the app are in harmony with that of the oracle.

# Market Creation Guidelines

* Market outcomes must be binary (resolvable via yes/no answers)
* A Market must contain a question and corresponding description which is written in English using precise language
* Market descriptions must contain rules specifying the circumstances under which a market is intended to be resolved
* Markets must be resolvable with credible resolution sources that are broadly accessible and reliable (eg - publicly available blockchain data, credible weather sources, credible news desks, official sports league websites, etc)
* Markets cannot be easily manipulatable&#x20;
* Markets must revolve around a clear event or have a specific cut off time (NO indefinitely running markets, eg - “will eth hit all time high one day?”)
* Markets cannot contain any obvious ambiguities&#x20;
* In addition to, and in accordance with the previous guideline, markets must adhere to common sense ethics that do not put humans' (or animals') health, well-being, or property in jeopardy
